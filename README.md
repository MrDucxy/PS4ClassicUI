# PS4ClassicUI
A WIP project to restore the pre-4.00 UI on the PS4 for jailbroken consoles.

Note: This targets people using 1080p or lower resolution. Using 4K resolution on a PS4 Pro may cause crashes or missing assets.

## Checklist
 - [ ] General UI Elements (Hover, Checkboxes, Loading Bars, Buttons, Etc.)
 - [ ] [IN PROGRESS] Icons (System app icons and other misc. icons)
 - [ ] [IN PROGRESS] Background Wave 
 - [ ] Various UI Animations (Loading Animation, Etc.)

## Contribute
If you would like to contribute to the project, you can DM me on Twitter @realducxy. I am mostly looking for pre-4.00 system files such as a complete NPXS20001 dump which includes RCOs and the wave0/wave1.fbxs files.
