# PS4ClassicUI
A WIP project to restore the pre-4.00 UI on the PS4 for jailbroken consoles.

Note: This targets people using 1080p or lower resolution. Using 4K resolution on a PS4 Pro may cause crashes or missing assets. (4k isnt prioritized, but will come eventually)

## Checklist
 #### General UI Elements
 - [X] Notification Background
 - [ ] Checkbox 
 - [ ] Progress Bar
 - [ ] Button Hover
 - [ ] List Background (pop out side menu)
 - [ ] Etc. (lots more that i didnt list lol)
  #### Icons
 - [X] System App Icons
 - [ ] Misc. Icons (if any have changed)

## Contribute
If you would like to contribute to the project, you can DM me on Twitter @realducxy. Right now I am looking for pre 4.00 UI files (RCOs), mainly ones that contain the main system UI elements (buttons, checkboxes, etc.)
Also looking for someone to help me reverse engineer the background wave format.
